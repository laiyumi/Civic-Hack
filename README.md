## üö® Inspiration: The Accessibility Gap

Web accessibility remains a critical challenge in the digital world. According to the **2024 WebAIM Million Report**, **95.9% of the homepages of the top 1 million websites** fail basic **W3C WCAG** accessibility checks, with an average of **56.8 errors per page**. Among the most common issues:

- **Low Contrast Text** was found on **81% of homepages**, making content difficult to read.
- **Missing Form Input Labels** have **doubled in the past five years**, with **35.5% of form inputs** lacking proper labels, making navigation harder for screen reader users.
- **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)** usage is increasing, but **often improperly implemented**, creating more barriers instead of solving them. Homepages using ARIA averaged **34.2% more errors** than those without.

Despite growing awareness, many developers struggle with **practical implementation** of accessibility standards. The **WCAG guidelines**, while comprehensive, can feel **overwhelming** and difficult to translate into real-world solutions. This knowledge gap contributes to persistent accessibility issues across the web.

## üéÆ Our Solution: Gamifying WCAG Learning

Instead of static guidelines or lengthy documentation, **A11y Zoo** transforms accessibility learning into **interactive mini-games**! Each game focuses on **one key WCAG principle**, allowing developers to **experience** accessibility issues firsthand and implement best practices in a fun, engaging way. From guiding a **chameleon to find color contrast**, to helping a **turtle travel along the hamburger menu**, our games make accessibility **intuitive and memorable** for developers.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built A11y Zoo

A11y Zoo is a **web-based educational platform** built using:

- **React & Next.js** for a seamless and interactive UI
- **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, responsive design
- **Lottie Animations** to bring our animal guides to life
- **Web Speech API & Keyboard Navigation** to simulate real accessibility experiences

Each game follows a structured approach, where developers **write code directly** in the editor and see how accessibility improvements impact the user experience in real-time.

## ‚ö° Challenges: Making Learning Fun & Interactive

One of the biggest challenges was **gamifying accessibility**‚Äîhow do we make developers _feel_ the impact of missing form label, broken keyboard navigation, or unreadable contrast? We had to design **engaging scenarios**, integrate **real-world accessibility tools**, and balance **education with entertainment**. Our solution was to introduce **animated animal guides** representing different accessibility challenges, creating a **playful but effective** learning experience.

Through **A11y Zoo**, we hope to make **web accessibility second nature** for developers‚Äîone game at a time! üöÄ‚ú®

## üèÜ Accomplishments We're Proud Of

We have built an **interactive interface** that connects a **code editor** with a **preview panel**, allowing users to see accessibility changes in real time. This setup makes it easier to understand the impact of different accessibility improvements.

## üéì What We Learned

Approaching accessibility from a **user‚Äôs perspective** helps in understanding its real-world impact. Experiencing accessibility challenges firsthand makes it clearer why these improvements matter and how they affect different users. This approach encourages more thoughtful implementation of accessibility best practices.
This experience also **deepened our knowledge of accessibility**, allowing us to apply these insights to future projects and build more inclusive digital experiences.

## üöÄ What's Next for A11Y Zoo

We plan to develop **more games** that address common accessibility issues highlighted in the **2024 WebAIM Million Report**. Additionally, we aim to **open-source the platform**, allowing contributors to create and expand accessibility learning tools for a wider audience.
